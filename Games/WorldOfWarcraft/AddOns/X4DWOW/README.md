# X4D World of Warcraft Add-Ons

# History

"Muboxer" was an Open Source AddOn for World of Warcraft meant to provide useful
features when multiboxing, it did not have dependencies on any other AddOn, it
also had a small memory footprint, and low cpu use.

You can find the original version of Muboxer on the "legacy" Mubox CodePlex codebase:
            
	http://mubox.codeplex.com

The Mubox project, including the latest X4DWOW Add-on source, can be found on github:

# About

The old Muboxer sources have been completely reworked to be cleaner, leaner, and more 
object oriented than before. X4DWOW attempts to meet the following goals:

* Must not violate any explicit Terms of Use, Terms of Service nor End User License Agreements set forth in the game.
* Must not depend on any third-party add-ons, unless they can be packaged without licensing/community conflicts.
* Must not introduce excessive CPU use, Memory use, nor network latency into the game.
* Must not modify the default UI, nor interfere with any popular UI mods (where 'popular' is >100k users.)
* Must provide default configuration that "just works."
* Must provide documentation that "anyone can understand."
