# Mubox

Mubox is a multiplexer emulator written in C#/.NET utilizing WPF and WinAPI. 

It offers "Keyboard Multicast", "Mouse Clone" and multiple-clients locally and remotely. 

Mubox is an Open-Source variation of pre-existing closed-source and/or proprietary multiplexer emulators such as 'Octopus', 'Multibox', and 'KeyClone'; though it makes no attempt to replicate the workflow nor features of these applications.
